#Provides an ingame technology browser.
It is a simple help system. With H (configurable) you get to an item what it is made of and where it is needed. This works in a lot of different places. In the help system you can get more information about the items with one click. 
There is also a history.

It is a tribute to the help system of Evospace. I hope factorio players will like it a lot as well.
The remidor panel is inspired by the one from Satisfactory.

###known issue:

- When using a research queue handler like the one from sonaxaton, ingteb-research may behave strange.
