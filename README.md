#Provides an ingame technology browser.
It is a simple help system. With H (configurable) you get to an item what it is made of and where it is needed. This works in a lot of different places. In the help system you can get more information about the items with one click. 
Also, you can trigger certain actions directly from the help system. 
- Research
- Handcrafting
- Pipette
There is a reminder panel with optional automatic research and (hand-)crafting.
There is also a history.

It is a tribute to the help system of Evospace. I hope factorio players will like it a lot as well.
The "remidor panel" is inspired by the one from Satisfactory.

###known issue: 
- Multiplayer: Desync issue when loading a save file where reminder panel is open *(help welcome!)*
- When using a research queue handler like the one from sonaxaton, ingteb-research may behave strange. (As a workaround, you can temporarily use the replacement mod [Improved Research Queue with interface](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-research-queue-with-interface) instead of [Improved Research Queue](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/sonaxaton-research-queue).)
